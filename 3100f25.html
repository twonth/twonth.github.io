                                                <p>UGA's <a href="https://capa.uga.edu/">CAPA</a> system contains the following Course Description of MATH 3100:</p>
                                                <blockquote>
                                                    Precise description of the real number system; rigorous treatment of limits and convergence for sequences, series, and functions; continuity and the maximum and intermediate value theorems; differentiation and the mean value theorem; Taylor approximation.
                                                </blockquote>
                                                <p>Those are indeed the topics we'll aim to cover this term. But if you really want to understand what sort of fine mess/math you've gotten yourself into, it will be useful to take a step back and think more philosophically. What is this course doing in the major?
                                                <p> There are two answers to this, equally important. On the one hand, this course aims to introduce you to one of  primary strands of mathematical thinking, &quot;mathematical analysis.&quot; (Many would say that &quot;algebra&quot; and &quot;analysis&quot; are the two cornerstones of mathematics.)
                                                    Analysis is the that branch of mathematics that grew out of calculus. So why not just call it calculus? We use a different word because we have a different focus. Calculus courses aim primarily to equip you to solve a wide range of problems. Analysis, at its most basic level, is about understanding why those solution methods make sense. That is, we want to understand the theory behind the practice. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The second raison d'être of this course is to serve as further practice for your writing of carefully reasoned mathematical proofs. <strong>You should not expect this to be easy</strong>; indeed, as you mature as a mathematician, you will find yourself confused a good deal of the time! (By the time you get to be a professional mathematician, you are constantl y confused.) I will do my best to guide you through the difficulties and to help you come out the other side. Of course, this depends a great deal on your own engagement with the material --- both in class and in office hours.
                                                </p>
                                                 <p>OK, that's 3100... but what about 3100<b>H</b>? Everything just discussed applies --- just moreso! As a student in 3100H, you will be asked to work additional problems on the homework assignments, meant to deepen your understanding of analysis and/or strengthen your understanding of mathematical logic and proof struture. 3100 students may attempt these problems for extra credit.

Both at office hours and in class, you should expect that your input will be treated respectfully, by myself and by your classmates. Turning it around, you are expected to show respect and understanding for your classmates’ ideas. Kindness is important --- everywhere and always!</p>

More than four unexcused absences may result in you being withdrawn from the course. Keep me posted whenever you have a conflict that requires you to miss class and this should not be an issue.

Mathematics wouldn't be nearly as much fun if we couldn't talk about it with other people! However, copying (from a textbook or another student), web searches, and AI tools (such as ChatGPT) are not allowed, and you must write your own final solutions independently.
