This directory contains the dos version of the march utility and
the R2->R3 source converter.

March is used to create and maintain Maple library archives.

The updtsrc utility converts Maple V Release 2 source (text) files
so that the handling of undeclared variables in Maple procedures
conforms to the rules of Maple V Release 3.
