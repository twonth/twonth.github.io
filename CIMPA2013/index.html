<h1><image src="cimpalecturing.jpg"> Analogies between integers and polynomials</h1>

<p>In late July, 2013, I had the of privilege  of delivering three two-hour lectures at the <a href="http://www.upd.edu.ph">University of the Philippines Diliman</a>, as part of a CIMPA-ICTP research school. The lectures discussed the analogies between the ring of integers <b>Z</b> and the ring  <b>F</b><sub><em>q</em></sub>[<em>T</em>] of polynomials over a finite field. Towards the second half of the course, we focused on analogies in prime number theory. All that was assumed was a working knowledge of the theory of finite fields.
<p>For students of the program, and all other interested parties, I include my lecture notes here.

<ul>
<li><strong>Lecture notes for hours 1--3</strong> [<a href="Part1.pdf">PDF</a>]<br>Topics include quadratic reciprocity for polynomials (in odd characteristic), Fermat's last theorem for polynomials and Mason's theorem, and the resolution by  R.E.A.C. Paley of an analogue of Waring's problem.
<li><strong>Lecture notes for hours 4--6</strong> [<a href="Part2.pdf">PDF</a>]<br>We started by discussing analogies between the classical prime number theorem and Gauss's formula for the number of irreducible polynomials of a given degree. We then proved Carlitz's theorem counting self-reciprocal (palindromic) irreducibles. The last part of the course focused on polynomial versions of the twin prime conjecture and the infinitude of primes of the form <em>n</em><sup>2</sup>+1.
