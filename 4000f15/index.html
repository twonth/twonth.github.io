		Proof that if $\alpha$ is constructible, then $[\mathbb{Q}[\alpha]:\mathbb{Q}] =2^j$
		for some nonnegative integer $j$. Examples of non-constructible numbers.
		</li>
	<li> 12/4: A point $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2$ is constructible if and only if $x$ and $y$ are constructible numbers. The constructible points form a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$.

Given a point $P$ and a line $\ell$, we can construct the line through $P$ perpendicular to $\ell$, and the line through $P$ parallel to $\ell$. Given $\alpha >0$ constructible, a point $P$ and a line $\ell$,  we can contruct the points on $\ell$ at a distance $\alpha$ from $P$. Start of the proof that the constructible numbers form a field.</li>
	<li>11/20: Midterm #3</li>
	<li>11/18: If $K/F$ is a degree $n$ extension of fields, then each $\alpha \in K$ is the root of some nonzero polynomial
		in $F[x]$, and its minimal polynomial has degree dividing $n$. If $[F[\alpha]: F]$ and $[F[\beta]:F]$ are 
		relatively prime, then $[F[\alpha,\beta]:F]=[F[\alpha]:F][F[\beta]:F]$. Related examples. Use of degree arguments to prove that every finite field has size $p^n$
		for some prime $p$ and some positive integer $n$.</li>
	<li>11/16: More review of linear algebra (span, linear independence, bases). Definition of $[K:F]$ for a field extension $K/F$. 
		$[F[\alpha]:F]$ has degree $n$ if $\alpha$ is the root of a degree $n$ irreducible polynomial over $F$. Proof that if $L/K$ and $K/F$ are finite extensions, then $[L:F]=[L:K][K:F]$.
		</li>
	<li>11/13: A prime in $\mathbb{Z}$ stays prime in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ if and only if $p$ is not of the form $x^2+y^2$ for any $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$.

<p>
At this point in your mathematical career, you have accumulated a wealth of experience computing with integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. These items are so familiar to you that they may even have the appearance of being God-given --- as if understanding those objects is What Mathematics is All About.
<p>
Abstract algebra challenges this notion. Integers, real numbers, and complex numbers are indeed fantastic, but they are fantastic not because they are handed down from on high, but because they have a rich and (presumably) consistent theory with useful consequences. And given how useful these objects are, we are compelled to isolate (and consider in the <i>abstract</i>) their most important properties. Once we do so, we find that there are many other objects with the same sorts of interesting properties. For example, we will see that the integers are an example of what is called a <i>ring</i>, while the real numbers and complex numbers are <i>fields</i>. These more abstract-seeming objects are not just interesting in an intellectual let's-talk-about-this-over-coffee kind of way, but understanding them deeply often leads to a new understanding of the objects of original interest.
<p>
Let me give one concrete example: Some primes, like 5, can be written as a sum of two squares: 5 = 1^2 + 2^2. And other primes, like 3, cannot. The question of when this is possible is a question about the integers. But our answer to this question --- and we will answer it by the end of the semester --- will require us to visit a totally different mathematically system, the <i>ring of Gaussian integers</i>. This is all connected with the picture at the top of the syllabus, in a way I will leave mysterious for now.

<P> There will be three hour-long <b>in-class</b> exams, as well as a final exam.
<ul>
  <li>Midterm #1: Friday, September 25</li>
  <li>Midterm #2: Wednesday, October 28</li>
  <li>Midterm #3: Friday, November 20</li>
  <li>Final exam: Monday, December 14, 12:00 PM--3:00 PM, usual classroom</li>
</ul>
No make-up exams will be given. The final exam <b>is cumulative</b>.

Your grade is made up of the following weighted components:
<ul>
  <li>Each midterm: 15% (total of 45%)</li>
  <li>Homework: 25%</li>
  <li>Final exam: 30%</li>
</ul>
<p>This class falls into the <i>interactive lecture</i> genre (not entirely unrelated to the practice of <i>call and response</i> in a liturgical context). What this means is that I intend to punctuate the lectures frequently with questions for you. For the show to go on, class participation is absolutely essential. Since you cannot participate in class if you are not present in class, your attendance is required. In particular, more than four unexcused absences may result in you being automagically withdrawn from the class. Of course, missing class is sometimes a necessity; keep me posted whenever you have a conflict and we should not have any issues.</p>
<p>Homework will be collected roughly once each week. As a general rule, late homework assignments are not accepted. Your lowest HW score will be dropped at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>All exams are closed book and closed notes.</p>
<p>Students enrolled in MATH 6000 will take the same exams as the students in MATH 4000 but will be assigned additional homework problems.
<p>You are not only allowed, but <b>encouraged</b> to collaborate with your classmates on the homework assignments. The joy of mathematical discovery was meant to be shared! Having said that, collaboration does not mean copying. You may not copy solutions from a textbook, classmate, website, etcetera, and you must be the one to handwrite (or type) your solutions. By entering UGA, you have already agreed to abide by the UGA honor code described in detail at &lt;<b>URL</b>: <a href="https://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy">https://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy</a>&gt;. A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to explain any work you turn in to a hypothetical interrogator.
