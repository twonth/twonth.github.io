                                                <p>The UGA bulletin describes the content of MATH 3100 as follows:</p>
                                                <blockquote>Precise definitions of limit and convergence concepts; practical tests for convergence of infinite series; power series representations and numerical error estimates; applications to calculus and explicit summation formulae; trigonometric series.
                                                </blockquote>
                                                <p>As far as topics are concerned, this is an adequate broad strokes description (although we may not cover all of these topics). However, that summary fails to capture the spirit of the course.</p>
                                                <p>Our mission (should you choose to accept it) is to become reacquainted with sequences and series, and to carefully study the basic structural properties of the real numbers that make proving results about sequences and series possible. I say "reacquainted" because many of the topics we discuss will be ones you have met in calculus. While there will be a lot of common terminology, the emphasis in this course is likely to be very different than any calculus course you may have had so far. Calculus courses usually stress the ability to solve a wide range of problems. In this course, we will aim at depth rather than breadth. We will focus our attentions on more foundational issues, with the goal of developing a deep understanding of what's `really going on'.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>A second raison d'être of this course is to train you to think like a mathematician. This includes the construction of carefully reasoned mathematical proofs. You should not expect this to be easy; indeed, since this is an honors course, I have a sacred duty to make sure that this is not easy! As in much of life, the two most important words to remember are DON'T PANIC. As you mature as a mathematician, you will find yourself confused a good deal of the time! (By the time you get to be a professional mathematician, you are constantly confused.) I will do my best to guide you through the difficulties and to help you come out the other side. Of course, this depends a great deal on your own engagement with the material --- both in class and in office hours.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Part of your mathematical apprenticeship is realizing that mathematics is a social endeavor: A "proof" that only you understand is sad, lonely creature, hardly worthy of the title. Assignments will be graded not only for mathematical correctness, but also on the quality of your explanations.</p>

More than four unexcused absences may result in you being withdrawn from the course. Keep me posted whenever you have a conflict that requires you to miss class and this should not be an issue.

Mathematics wouldn't be nearly as much fun if we couldn't talk about it with other people! However, copying (from a textbook or another student) and web searches are not allowed, and you must write your own final solutions independently. Keep in mind that by entering UGA, you have already agreed to abide by the UGA Honor code described in detail at <a href="http://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy">http://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy</a>.

A reasonable rule of thumb is that you should be able to explain your solutions verbally to me (in all their gory detail) if requested to do
