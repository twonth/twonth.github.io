                                                <p>The <a href="https://bulletin.uga.edu/CoursesHome?cid=973">UGA bulletin</a> describes the content of MATH 3100 as follows (see also the <a href="https://capa.uga.edu/">CAPA</a> <a href="/3100f22/CAPA.pdf">description</a>):</p>
                                                <blockquote>Precise definitions of limit and convergence concepts; practical tests for convergence of infinite series; power series representations and numerical error estimates; applications to calculus and explicit summation formulae; trigonometric series.
                                                </blockquote>
                                                <p>As far as topics are concerned, this is an adequate broad strokes description (although we may not cover all of these topics). However, that summary fails to capture the spirit of the course.</p>
                                                <p>Our mission (should you choose to accept it) is to become reacquainted with sequences and series, and to carefully study the basic structural properties of the real numbers that make proving results about sequences and series possible. I say "reacquainted" because many of the topics we discuss will be ones you have met in calculus. While there will be a lot of common terminology, the emphasis in this course is likely to be very different than any calculus course you may have had so far. Calculus courses usually stress the ability to solve a wide range of problems. In this course, we will aim at depth rather than breadth. We will focus our attentions on more foundational issues, with the goal of developing a deep understanding of what's `really going on'.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>A second raison d'être of this course is that you continue the mathematical apprenticeship which you begun in MATH 3200. This includes the construction of carefully reasoned mathematical proofs. <strong>You should not expect this to be easy</strong>; indeed, as you mature as a mathematician, you will find yourself confused a good deal of the time! (By the time you get to be a professional mathematician, you are constantly confused.) I will do my best to guide you through the difficulties and to help you come out the other side. Of course, this depends a great deal on your own engagement with the material --- both in class and in office hours.

I strongly recommend that you show up at office hours (times TBD); even better, show up and bring a friend! Note that these are intended as collaborative problem solving sessions. As such: You should expect me to give hints and to follow up on ideas you tried, not to simply telegraph answers.</p>
<p>
Both at office and in class, you should expect that your input will be treated respectfully, by myself and by your classmates. Turning it around, you are expected to show respect and understanding for your classmates’ ideas. Kindness is always important, and in these difficult times even more important than usual.</p>

Mathematics wouldn't be nearly as much fun if we couldn't talk about it with other people! However, copying (from a textbook or another student) and web searches are not allowed, and you must write your own final solutions independently.
