                                                <p>At this point in your mathematical career, you have accumulated a wealth of experience computing with integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. These items are so familiar to you that they may even have the appearance of being God-given --- as if understanding those objects is What Mathematics is All About.</p>
                                                <p>Abstract algebra challenges this notion. Integers, real numbers, and complex numbers are indeed fantastic, but they are fantastic not because they are handed down from on high, but because they have a rich and (presumably) consistent theory with useful consequences. And given how useful these objects are, we are compelled to isolate (and consider in the abstract) their most important properties. Once we do so, we find that there are many other objects with the same sorts of interesting properties. For example, we will see that the integers are an example of what is called a <em>ring</em>, while the real numbers and complex numbers are <em>fields</em>. These more abstract-seeming objects are not just interesting in an intellectual let's-talk-about-this-over-coffee kind of way, but understanding them deeply often leads to a new understanding of the objects of original interest.</p>
                                                <p>Let me give one concrete example: Some primes, like 5, can be written as a sum of two squares: $5 = 1^2 + 2^2$. And other primes, like 3, cannot. The question of when this is possible is a question about the integers. But our answer to this question --- and we will answer it by the end of the semester --- will require us to visit a totally different mathematically system, the <em>ring of Gaussian integers</em>.</p>

This corresponds roughly to Chapters 1--6 and some of Chapter 11 in Hungerford's book. For further adventures in Algebra-land, I encourage you to take MATH 4010.</p>

What this means is that I intend to punctuate the lectures frequently with questions for you. For the show to go on, class participation is absolutely essential. Since you cannot participate in class if you are not present in class, your attendance is required. In particular, more than four unexcused absences may result in you being automagically withdrawn from the class. Of course, missing class is sometimes a necessity; keep me posted whenever you have a conflict and we should not have any issues.

                                                    <p>Homework will be collected roughly once each week. As a general rule, late homework assignments are not accepted. Your lowest HW score will be dropped at the end of the semester.

                                                    <p>Students enrolled in MATH 6000 will take the same exams as the students in MATH 4000 but will be assigned additional homework problems.

The joy of mathematical discovery was meant to be shared! Having said that, collaboration does not mean copying. You may not copy solutions from a textbook, classmate, website, etcetera, and you must be the one to handwrite (or type) your solutions. By entering UGA, you have already agreed to abide by the UGA honor code described in detail at <a href="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/">https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/</a>. A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to explain any work you turn in to a hypothetical interrogator.</p>

                                                <p>Mathematics is not a spectator sport! One learns mathematics by doing it. What I'll be sharing with you in class can be thought of as a hindsight-informed summary of productive struggle by many mathematics over several centuries. Just as it's impossible to absorb the material in a textbook by sleeping with the book under your pillow, it's impossible for you to come to grips with the results of their hard labor by sitting in lectures. Thinking hard about problems --- and being stumped a good deal of the time! --- is part and parcel of coming into your own as a mathematical person.</p>
                                                <p>Office hours exist to make this struggle a little more pleasant. They are intended to function as a safe space for you to share ideas and to work through the homework, with the support of both myself and your peers. I strongly encourage you attend.</p>
                                                <p>Both at office hours and in class, you should expect that your input will be treated respectfully, by myself and by your classmates. Turning it around, you are expected to show respect and understanding for your classmates’ ideas. Kindness is important, everywhere and always!</p>
